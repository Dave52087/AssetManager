# Asset Manager
The Asset Manager App is a total equipment management system designed to help organisations with a large number of assets, many of which are supplied by different companies and which need regular preventative maintenance and servicing often by yet another set of companies. The Asset Manager App allows companies to track which assets they own, what the maintenance history is of those assets are, when the next service is due and details of which company provides the service cover, including details of the value of the service contract. The Asset Manager App also provides for email notification to staff who need to be informed whenever the status of an asset changes.
